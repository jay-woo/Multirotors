# Multirotors
Research in Andrew Bennett's Lab. Using Multirotors to conduct environmental exploration, sensing, and sampling missions.

## Projects
This code repository contains the mission files and the general architecture for several mission types which can be executed with drones, namely:

* Breath Condensate Collection from a Cetacean
* Wireless Tracker Tagging for a large Cetacean
* Photogrammetry for Animal Studies
* Point-of-Interest Data Collection
* Environmental Exploration
* Waypoint Navigation
* Sense and Avoid of Unfriendly Multirotors

Each of these missions is designed in a mission file. This mission file is then executed by a generic autonomy structure based upon State Configured Layer Control (SCLC) which controls the actions of the drone.

## Running this Code
*Still under construction*
