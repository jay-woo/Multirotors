# Code Organization

The folders have been temporarily organized by task, and the file `drone.py` contains a helper class that collects important data from `mavros` via callback functions.

# To Do
- [x] Merge all important files from old repo
- [ ] Update `/Fiducial Tracking` to use `/ar_pose` instead of old fiducial
- [ ] Review and revise `/Mission Planning` files (test that everything works)
- [x] Reorganize folders based on arbiter / state / sense
